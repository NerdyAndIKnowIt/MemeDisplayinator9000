### FAQ
- Q: Is this legal?
- A: Yes, this tool uses the Reddit API and is a registered and approved reddit app.


- Q: What kind of memes does this take? 
- A: Currently just IT and software development related memes, if you want me to make a specific version such as a cute kitten and puppy version lmk.


- Q: What Reddit subs do these IT memes come from?
- A: This may change in the future, but currently: r/iiiiiiitttttttttttt, r/ProgrammerHumor, r/ShittySysadmin, r/Sysadminhumor, r/windowsmemes, r/cablegore, r/networkingmemes, r/linuxmasterrace, r/programmingmemes


- Q: Are there any content filters?
- A: Not currently that is part of my code, but each sub I take these memes from have their own rules for posting content. No irrelavent memes will be upvoted in groups that large. The script ran by the lambda function every week only selects the top memes each month. I may add content restrictions in the future if it becomes an issue.


- Q: How frequently do new IT memes get added to the slideshow?
- A: Each week the lambda function executes a script to retrieve the top memes of the last month.
